      I've heard that it is a good idea to load scripts at the
      *end* of a page, the idea being: the non-script elements
      of the page are loaded by the time the scripts run. but,
      here we use 'defer' on the script tag which tells the 
      browser to load the script only after all page element
      are loaded.
